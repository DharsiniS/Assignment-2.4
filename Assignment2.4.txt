1. Explain the importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster

*NameNode is the core of  HDFS.
*Its also known as the Master.
*It doesnt store the actual data or the dataset.
*The data itself is stored in the DataNodes.
*It knows all the list of blocks and its location for any given file in HDFS.
*It stores metadata of HDFS in a directory tree containing all the files of the file system and tracks the file across the
  cluster.
*NameNode is usually configured with larger RAM because the block locations are in the main memory.
*NameNode is so critical to HDFS. When the NameNode is down, Hadoop cluster is inaccessible.
*It acts as the single point of failure in hadoop cluster.
